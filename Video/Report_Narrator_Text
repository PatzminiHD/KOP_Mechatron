While being not older than 19 years, 6 students created a prototype for a firetruck that can get everywhere it needs to go. We wanted to know what their motivation was, and got an interview with each team member. The first interview was with the team leader Paul Köglberger, an 18 year old student from Christkindl.

We found this dude that was willing to do an interview with us. He said something about being part of the construction team.

Mister Köglberger and Mister Templ were responsible for the electronics part of the project.

The programmer was also willing to do a short interview. Though I have to say, he looks a bit weird.

Experts expect that this technology will be available to all firetrucks in less then 5 years.
