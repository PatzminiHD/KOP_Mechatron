    [Interview with team leader]
    Q: "Why did you come up with this?"
    A: "We noticed that often times firetrucks have a hard time to get to their destination, because the roads are narrow and there are many obsticales in the way.
        So we thought that those trucks would need higher flexibility in how they move. Thats how we came up with the Idea for omnidirectional wheels."
    Q: "That makes sense. So tell me, what were the challenges you faced, on a project level scale?"
