6 students of the HTL Steyr invented a revolutionary new way of moving firetrucks.
Report by Oliver Lehner

Bugs in CAD Software are getting worse.

A recent survey shows that more and more people complain about finding new bugs in the CAD Software they use.

About 69 percent of people say they have encountered at least one bug,

With 31 percent saying they have encountered at least 4 errors in the last year.

The application that is most impacted seems to be Creo by PTC

The company has not yet responded to these complaints

Unfortunately we are experiencing technical difficulties with reaching the DJ
for a live interview

Thanks for joining us in this years issue of CAD-News. I will see you again next year
